Rude flight supervisor at the airport desk,I have travelled from London to Dhaka direct flight due to COVID and it was my first time I have experienced Bangladesh biman and definitely my last time . While sending my luggage the staffs on the gate harassed me I felt because I had enough allowance and I only had a small bag hand where I hardy had anything so they could allow 2 kilo more in my luggage rather than asking for extra money (staffs are irrelevant ) and then making me open my luggage thousand times . Also the gate flight supervisor a lady at London Heathrow airport terminal 2 was very rude she didn’t even listen what I was gonna say instead she said just to save your time u have pay extra this and that like she didn’t even try to listen what I was trying to say . Very disappointing she had no manner how to behave and talk to passengers and she is a supervisor like what ... the cabin crew were well behaved but you can hardly find cabin crew during quiet time as they are always in their station but they were well behaved. Just didn’t like the gate staffs specially the lady supervisor of that wasn’t uk I would have slapped her for that behaviour like we pay for service and want to get that service we do not travel for free or with their fathers money . Also the food during the flight came very late for awhile I wanted to jump out of the plane because I was starving ... they need to give food on time . More Improvement needed and staffs need more training and definitely should not hire staffs who doesn’t know how to behave with passengers . I felt it because I am a tourism and hospitality employee at a fairmont hotel in London and I have trained air hostesses at from Saudi airlines do I know how passengers should be treated . Pleas give more training to customer service staffs at the airport thanks . For me ... never travelling from bd biman worst behaved at the luggage desk ... staffs are always gossiping ... poor service at the luggage desk... also the cabin crews are not very attentive they forgot to give me my food and they did not re check if all passengers got food I had to call someone to give me food ...,"Reviewed January 13, 2021 ",Date of travel: January 2021,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines,1 of 5 bubbles

Overall review of US Bangla Airlines,"The worst airlines, run by irresponsible, and stupid people. They have no sense of time and service. If you ask any assistance, whether they don't know they answer, they will give you even terrible suggestions which will make your life real hell and finally you will realize their suggestion was unnecessary. I had no other option that's why I needed to fly with them and I wish I never again fall in such situation.

And to get help, I've called their helpline innumerable times and tried connecting to an operator; but every-time they disconnect after keeping the line engaged for a while.

So we wanted to talk to somebody about what to do, but nobody was there, so I called a friend who was an employee of Biman ( Lawyer) , as she heard my problem, she started misbehaving and shouting with ill manner. We were just confused about what to do, then my husband talked to a man in the airport and that man managed the Malaysian airline to take us to KL.. Again, on the Biman after a year while travelling from KL to Dhaka our suitcase was cut and important and expensive things were stolen.

Bad experience with Biman,"I was just wondering whats the point of submitting feedback to Biman and its authority since this may not go any further and on the other hand do they even do anything with the feedback that they receive. Despite all my views and thoughts I still believe it is my duty to share my disappointment and disturbance that it caused me and my family through this recent flight/journey with Biman through this feedback process. Worse come to worse I will raise this with Aviation Authority if needed. I would like Biman management to understand that passengers won't waste time and effort without a valid reason to do so, surely everyone has better things to do in life. It upsets me and loads of others like myself is that you get treated like animals from your own people despite spending the extortionate amount of money to travel with Biman, clearly Biman being monopoly player serving direct flight to Sylhet and taking advantage of all Sylhety travelers. Coming to my main feedback from my recent flight from Sylhet to Dhaka and then Dhaka to London Heathrow on 16/01/20 and then on 17/01/20. As usual the flight was delayed first by half an hour then by 1 hour and 25 minutes from Sylhet to Dhaka flight. From Dhaka airport to the hotel for overnight stay was unbearable experience. I had to wait outside the airport for almost an hour with my kids for bus/car where we were bitten by mosquitoes, dehydrated, hungry and really vulnerable. Where hotel representative kept on saying to us that the bus will be here within next 10 minutes even though we had to wait for almost an hour. But all of us were thinking that some how we need to get to the hotel where we all have a good rest and freshenup  Eventually, when we reached the hotel ""Hotel Platinum, in Uttara"" unfolded our biggest surprise. The room that was allocated to 6 of us seemed like staff quarters, dirty, blankets had blood spots on and a smelly bathroom. My kids could not sleep because of bed bugs and mosquitoes (I have taken pictures of all as evidence). As we were all hungry, first thing I've asked is that when would the dinner be served and if I can see the owner or the hotel manager. This is to raise my concern which I did later on  In terms of dinners/servings, this was very limited amount of food, only rice, chicken curry, dall and vegetable bhaji. Clearly not a lot on offer and clearly it felt that we were forcing the attendants for after meal tea refreshment which came at a cost of 50 Taka for 4 cups On the day flight we have been escorted out of the room 2 hours early and had to wait in the lobby Flight attendants from Dhaka to London Heathrow were rude and felt like that they do not have any manners, clearly treating us like a mole. One point when they were serving drinks where I had 2 of my kids were sitting beside me where I was asking them what drink were they having because they taking latterly more 20-25 seconds but we were told to hurry up and this point I said WHAT! and the respond I get was that they have other passengers to serve which I totally get but for GOD SAKE! They are kids. I'm sure they won't treat their kids like that. On the other hand they don't even ask what we were going to have as a meal instead they were forcing chicken curry and rice which we did not prefer. Clearly their seems to be a language barrier which I get but they do not pose any manners let alone they would have customer service knowledge In the best interest of Biman's success and reputation, hope something is being done","Reviewed April 20, 2020 ",Date of travel: January 2020,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines,1 of 5 bubbles
Worst experience ever!,"Very poor service. I wouldn’t recommend Bangladesh Biman to anyone after what happened to us. Was made to sit in our seats with someone’s poo in the aisle covered with a newspaper sheet as the staff weren’t mothered you clean it. This then spread along the entire aisle as people were stepping on it and moving it everywhere with their feet. Plus when you press the bell for them to come, they ignore it and you have to get up and go and get them. Disgusting service! Not forgetting to mention the hotel that they made us stay at in Dhaka as our flight was the next day. The hotel called White Rose was dirty, hair all over the bedcovers, floor looked like it hadn’t been sweeped for days and the fan switch wouldn’t work so we were stuck with our three children including our 6 month baby with a fan that went at full speed and wouldn’t turn down. When we tried to turn it off, the mosquitoes were biting the he’ll out of us. They only spray aerosol so they didn’t even have solutions for this other than that!","Reviewed March 30, 2020 ",Date of travel: March 2020,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines,1 of 5 bubbles

Trip report with Biman 787-9 ,The whole experience with Biman on their new service from Manchester direct to Sylhet was exceptional to say the least.

You won’t believe it!!,"I regularly fly business class on Emirates, BA, Etihad and Turkish AirlinesThis was every bit as good. The plane was probably the newest plane I’ve ever been on. Brand new 787. I couldn’t find a mark or a scuff. The seat was full lie flat and the layout was better than my recent flight with BA from LHR to Islamabad. The screen size was good. The food from LHR was amongst the best I’ve had. Succulent lamb shank with boiled potatoes. Just perfect. Return flight food was far less impressive and they have a problem with mosquitos on the return flight (same problem last year)Considering where Biman ranks in international airlines, I couldn’t really fault it except to say their on board entertainment is poor.

My Biman 787-9 experience,"I went Bangladesh for 1 month from London Heathrow to Sylhet. One thing Biman needs to improve on is to have more direct flights especially from Sylhet to London Heathrow because I had to go to Dhaka and stay there overnight at a disgusting hotel. Anyways I survived there and then it was my long-haul flight from Dhaka to London Heathrow (11 hours). We took the new Biman 787-9 which was really good. The seats were very comfortable and the windows now have tints instead of the previous window shades. One problem was that because it was a new plane, they didn’t set the IFE screen which meant there was no flight entertainment which was was a shame since it was a morning flight and everyone was awake. However they still operate a flight live map which will satisfy me but definitely not the kids. Our plane was delayed by 2 hours which i don't really mind but however the kids... I landed in London in the will of Allah but I still did enjoy the flight.

Worst airline ever,"Despite leaving home 6 hours before check in closed, my 2 hour journey took 4 hours due to sudden and severe snowfall. Got to check in with 30 minutes to spare, but wasnt allowed to join the queue as the number of people waiting already meant they would breach check in closure times (apparently), even though the flight was delayed by 3 hours BECAUSE of the weather!!!!Was advised that if the Biman office called and cleared me to board, they'd let me check in. My agent got Biman office to call and the person who received the call then checked my ticket and boarding pass, but did nothing else. Before I knew it, they'd cleared out the check in area and I was left with no choice but to book a hotel and pay for new tickets for the next day.Typical of a backwards country airline, they conveniently have no desk at LHR for people to make enquiries or complaints. When I eventually travelled out the next day, the flight was delayed by about 3 hours due to bad weather. Again, no Biman staff at LHR to provide food or drink vouchers like other reputable airlines do. I therefore booked into a lounge as the airport was packed out, but they never refunded me for that expense when the provision of food and drinks for a 3+ hour delay is technically their responsibility.The flight itself was relatively calm. In flight movies were old and headphone ports didn't work. Food definitely needs to improve. Staff on the plane were very nice though and their attention to customer needs was pretty good too. That's the ONLY positive part of this whole ordeal.Came back to UK at the end of Jan and despite several emails to Biman with details of what happened, their poor service at the airport etc and it resulting in me being forced to buy a new ticket, they've NEVER responded. I even sent letters to their head office in Bangladesh, but still nothing.

Much better than expected,"It is easy to find a lot of less than complimentary reviews of Biman Bangladesh in the internet so on this, my first experience with them, I would be lying if I said I had no concerns. However, the flight to Chittagong was a fairly new 737 with a Business Class section and on the way back a fairly new Bombardier turboprop. Both very clean on the inside and no dramas at all on either flight. Granted, in flight service was basic but it is less than 1 hour flight so no issue there. I would be fine flying again with Biman and keep in mind that they are safety approved for flights in and out of EU airspace.","Reviewed October 11, 2019 ",Date of travel: September 2019,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines,3 of 5 bubbles
Fastest connection to UK,"First time took Biman to London on a 777-300ER. Just great connection to London. Its almost 11hrs flight, flight departs around 10.15am BST and arrives in London by 3.45pm GMT. Business class seats are comfortable and food is good. Service level has improved and crew are very well trained. Flight entertainment is not the best but it is OK. Cost is very reasonable compared to other airlines. Emirates, Kuwait, Gulf Air, Qatar and Turkish airlines fly via their hub to London from Dhaka and it takes much longer due to transit plus the fare is higher by 30% to 50% than Biman. So value for money and fastest connection, I would highly recommend Biman. Ground handling needs more improvement. Other than that, super service and Biman should increase its frequency to 7 days, I think there is enough demand.

We tried Dhaka-Dubai business class in the new Dreamliner. It was a mistake. ,"After confirming with the airline that they operate the new Dreamliner on the route, we booked DAC-DXB in business class. This route has a 1hr technical stop in Chittagong before proceeding to Dubai. If your destination is Dubai, then you cannot get off the plane in Chittagong. I was only willing to fly this route with Biman on their new Dreamliner. Their other planes are ancient. The aircraft was indeed the 787 Dreamliner. Business class seat was full lay flat. Comfortable seats, although not comparable to business class on flagship carriers. Unfortunately 3 business class seats were occupied by snotty, screaming kids with a mother unwilling to control them and flight attendants unwilling to care. Flight attendants did even attempt to calm the kids or assist the mother.Food is barely edible. Very greasy, spongy, and chewy. Some items unidentifiable. We left most of it uneaten. Here's the real problem: Biman simply cannot keep a time schedule. We've flown them a number of times and they are ALWAYS late. Today, we departed Dhaka only 10 minutes late, which was remarkable. But then we landed in Chittagong 20 minutes late. By the time we left Chittagong we were 2 hours late. By the time we landed in Dubai we were 2.5 hrs late. We had a connecting flight on another airline, which we missed, and forced to pay rebooking fee for that airline. We had to wait for the next flight so we lost a night's sleep which defeated the purpose of buying the Biman business class seat in the first place. Biman customer service is terrible. As we got further and further behind schedule, there were no apologies, no explanation. There is no alcohol on Biman, even in international business class.The price was right for this business class product, but the persistent tardiness of Biman is a huge deterrent. In the end we lost time, lost sleep, lost money, and arrived frustrated. I don't recommend Biman.","Reviewed October 3, 2019 ",Date of travel: October 2019,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines,2 of 5 bubbles

Value for money!,"Overall had a very good experience with biman on both legs. I will go point wise and will be easier to comprehend. 1. We were lucky to get the brand new dreamliner. The business class configuration was 2-2-2 so everyone had aisle access.2. Check in was fast and quick. We were given the fast track card to use at lhr. We used EBL lounge at Dhk airport but wife tried Bimans Muslin lounge. Food was good and mainly local. 3. Boarding was done on time and we took our seats. Was super comfortable and fully flat bed with plenty of leg space, big screen tv with ok entertainment channels. 4. Onboard service was just above average. The cabin crew needs to smile more and at least dhow they are willing to go the extra mile for business class passengers. We are paying a premium and hence expect premium service. 5. Biman doesn't serve alcohol but enroute from LHR-DAC you can huy the mini bottles mainly whiskey, gin, vodka. 6. Food was good but their second mesl was below par. Why serve fried items when it just gets all soggy? See pic pls. Their local meals were very good. 7. Their cheeseboard platter was average. Should have a variety and with premium crackers.8. Toilet was a bit too small for business class cabin.9. LHR to DAC was comfortable and we had a good sleep. I was really hungry and literally requested a second meal and was given.10. Reached London on time- however the taxing is a really far away corner and we walked 20 min to go to immigration.Overall had a good experience with Biman.

Another trip on Biman... another pretty lackluster experience. Very disrespectful to paying customers.,"Review of Biman Business Class DAC-KUL. I've flown and reviewed Biman a number of times over the last 3 years. It has not improved... in fact, I think it has gotten worse. If Business is this bad, imagine Economy. Here's my notes from the flight:• The bus took us out to the plane, but the the plane wasn't ready, so they dumped all passengers on the curb at the foot of the stairs to the plane, and we all stood there for a good 20 minutes outside with absolutely no information from any staff. Unsafe, unprofessional, disrespectful. (see pic)• Departed 1 hr late.• Food in lounge inedible, greasy, disgusting• Strange box in my seat area on the flood upon boarding, no attempt by crew to move it. I had to kick it out of my seating area. Just strange, very disrespectful. (see pic).• No alcohol, even in business class.• Seat broken switch. • They use the overhead bins over business class row 3 to store a ton of stuff that you'd think belong in the galley. So, not even enough room for a backpack above my business class seat.• So she spent a commutative hour of the flight rummaging in the bin over my head. Distracting, annoying, and disrespectful to the customer.• Flight attendant had to use a butter knife to release the remote from the arm rest.• When we ordered dinner, flight attendant seemed extremely perplexed by our decisions. Like it was also the first time she had ever seen the menu. • Flight attendant used her gloved hand to wipe her runny nose immediately before serving dinner. • Threw the napkins at us. • Took a full 1.5 hrs after take off before dinner served in business class. I continue to fly Biman because they offer day-time flights and a cheaper ticket, especially in Business Class.

Very comfortable and convenient!,Flew business class from Bkk to Dac and was absolutely worth it given the price. Check in was fast with 45kgs allowed for the 2 hour flight. Fast track enabled quick security check and immigration. I was given access to the miracle lounge near the gate which was decent and comfortable. Biman uses the old 737 800 which has the old type business class seats. No tv though but really didn't matter for the 2 hour flight. Only thing missing was the foot rest which would have made it perfect. Seats were spacious and comfortable with sufficient recline. Onboard service was warm and friendly and courteous. Food was good and filling and menu had good options. On arrival seperate cars were available for business class passengers which enabled us to reach immigration faster. Would definitely recommend biman's business class more so due to the convenient timing b/c a quick nap between 4pm to 6 pm is perfect for this type of cabin.

Customer care is ZERO ,"I have used Biman before but not long haul. I chose this flight over other carriers because it’s the only non-stop flight, it’s baggage allowance was better and it was cheaper. I think the problem is that because of this, they can fill a huge plane every time so they don’t have to try too hard on customer service. I was suspicious when our departure time changed to an hour earlier but arrival time didn’t. When we arrived nice and early to check in, there was a queue but no staff and after 30 mins of waiting the departure time changed back 45mins later. Eventually we got checked in but had basically arrived an hour too early and had to hang around. When we went to the gate it was very full so we stood expecting that boarding would soon start. After an hour I went back out to the desk to see what the delay was and was told that the captain had not arrived!When the captain finally showed up and boarding began, a single door was opened and everyone barged through with no staff in sight. So we were told to come an hour early and ended up flying an hour and a half late. There was no apology or evening mention of delay and at no time was there any communication from airline or airport staff. It is an 11 hour flight and there are 2 very basic meals. By midday I had been up 7 hours with nothing but an airport coffee in my stomach and I was given a cup of tepid water. At sometime between the 2 meals I was staring at my broken screen and I was in need of a snack. No staff were in the aisles so I went to the galley. There were self service soft drinks so I got the tepid water and asked if there were snacks. I was given some very dry cake which I was told was ‘absolutely free’.

Its much of the same,"My third flying experience with Biman. Do they really care what we write? Traveling with this airline has always been strange, funny, weird and full of unpleasant surprises. So after my recent travel with Biman, this is what we experienced.I was flying to Bangkok. So first of all upon check in your staffs were surprising a bit friendly. That was the first though. You all usually are not that friendly, smiling and helpful. So I hope you all keep that up. Secondly your food service seems to be different from DEPARTURE to ARRIVAL. On the way to Bangkok the plane was very well clean, all seats had TV monitor and your meals were well portioned and with tea and coffee. But on the way back it was a whole new dimension. The food was limited without salad and no tea or coffee? And no TV? No blankets? Whats up with that? Thats not really fair. We paid in full for the service for TO and FROM and we should expect it exactly right. This is just with you Biman. No other airlines does this. So the flight on the way back from BKK, I was so looking forward to have my coffee with the cake that came with the meal. I mean you cancelled Tea and Coffee totally? Is it that bad that you cant provide a bit of tea which is an essential thing among Bangladeshi nationals? You also charge for wheel chair? What other airlines does that? On the way to Bangkok I was watching a movie and I was enjoying it but towards the end you have to put that LONG Biman ADVERT and I felt like thats it, its over. I put away my headphone and all got ready for landing. But then again you put the movie back on right after the ADVERT. Didnt felt like watching it because it was so annoying with your disturbances. You could have had that ADVERT put just as we have LANDED. Thats all other airlines do. You all lack CONSISTENCY in every aspect. In the beginning you all are like SUPER FANTASTIC and after few WEEKS you all become zero and you all stay at zero. Staying CONSISTENT in this business of SERVICE SECTOR is the key. No matter what, how little or much you provide, you have to set and keep a proper ground on it. The meal you provide is just good enough. I like your meal. But you are not being consistent wit it. Like I said earlier one day this but the next day its something else for the same price. Why is it everywhere in every aspect the organization lack decency, lack respect and lack morale? Can this organization do something right? I mean the Airport is a mess....starting with the parking lot. Have any one of you (officials) been there? Especially that part where the arrival passengers come with their luggage with trolley and wait for their cars. Its nasty looking and so dirty. Is this how a INTERNATIONAL airport suppose to look like? I can go on and on. But I feel thats enough for now. Lets see how you all respond to this. Its no rocket science people.

"Appalling service despite great views of Everest, felt unsafe","There's nothing worse than travelling on an unsafe airline, sitting next to someone who's just witnessed a crash by the same airline and can't stop talking about it, with air stewards not even doing proper safety checks.After much reluctance I decided to purchase a ticket on Biman, which doesn't have a great safety record, from Dhaka to Kathmandu.I thought ""Surely safety comes first"". Then this woman sitting next to me who had just transferred from Yangon explains she witnessed a Biman plane nosedive and crash the day before. She was due to board that very aircraft back to Dhaka. Google it, it happened.Meanwhile on our Kathmandu bound flight, at no point did the cabin crew (at least visibly) make that extra safety check, let alone check that everyone's seat belts were securely fastened or that the cabin was free from potential obstructions in case of an evacuation. The staff were extremely arrogant throughout.And while service shouldn't (isn't?) related to safety, there was none of it. Seated in the first row after business, no sooner had we bitten into our sandwiches did the stewardess walk out and say ""You done yet?"" rolling her eyes when we said we'd just started. I couldn't stop thinking of the airline's crash the day before: in such situations one can't help but think they won't give a damn.And me being picky, I noticed the cabin was filthy inside. Again, I hope that dirt does not equate to lower safety, but poor maintenance does nothing to reassure passengers on an airline with an already poor reputation.

There is nothing good I can say about this airline except for 40kg limit and goes direct to Sylhet. It is the worse plane and airline service I have ever traveled in and ever will. Even when I went Business class the service was poor. The entertainment system did not work at all both way, luckily I was able to recline my seat and sleep. Food was ok, they give you a lot, specially in Business class. What I didn't like is it was very oily. Price for economy is also expensive as it will be cheaper to travel by other airline (back in the days British Airways used to go there but the government doesn't like competition). The service is poor, that staff lack any manner as they don't care. Flights are always delayed and never on time (not sure why they can't correct this even from Bangladesh as they are like the only operator in the airport in Bangladesh, so no logical reason for delay. Not sure why don't have direct flights from Sylhet to London, instead they do transit via Dhaka, where the staff hassle you a lot saying unless you pay them, your luggage will not make it to its destination. Also they make you stay over night in Dhaka even thou your travelling from Sylhet (I suppose its the doggy politician want to make some money for them self by making passengers stay in their hotel)Last time I went with my father and traveled in Business class as he needs wheel chair. Before I come back I went to confirm my ticket in Sylhet office and also to confirm that my father will get a wheel chair. To get a confirmation that there will be wheel chair I had to pay them? really.

Our first ever flight and last,"We have travelled as a family from London to Dhaka first time in our life with Biman and this would be our last trip. We have travelled 42 countries some of them several times around the world in five continents so used over 200s flights. 1. Toilet tissue paper ran out despite request to the crews no action taken 2. Cabin crews need further training3. Our family members were split with two teenage children and sat differently. 4. In twelve hours flight one main meal and one snack which are inadequate. It should be two snacks at least 5. Flights were delayed for nearly three hours6. Met a newly wed couple from London who missed the flight from Dhaka because the flight was overbooked 7. If you are not bothered about delay, missing the flight for overbooking, customer services, and splitting up the family seating arrangements then feel free to use Biman.

Biman 787 seats are congested. .,"Was delighted to find a new 787 aircraft on service for our flight that day. Unfortunately when inside, found the seats are much cramped. There were 9 seats in a row, instead of 8 seats normally. Service of cabin crew is also unimpressive. They were just doing their duty, but not in a professional manner. One male steward was collecting the food tray and putting those in the trolly. He pushed so hard that some trays with unfinished mill and garbage etc. just rolled out from another side, making a mess in front of my seat. Though he cleaned it but that wetty messy stained path area was awful. Had to seat beside that messy area for rest of my flight time. That steward took that incident very casually and tried to close the trolly door by kicking. Maybe this way they have broken the locks of food trolly. Other female hostess were elderly and could not walk properly even. Suggestion: 1. Seats in Dreamliner should be similar to 777 or similar to another airline economy 2 Cabin crews. should be well trained and need some supervision.","Reviewed April 15, 2019 ",Date of travel: February 2019,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines,3 of 5 bubbles

I guess you can't really expect more? Yes you can.,Boarding was similar to other airlines: pretty efficient. The boeing 777-300 appeared to be in serious need of an interior-refurb. Seats were in a dilapidated state. Entertainment-system controls were broken on some seats. So (for example) My wife's screen was stuck on a blank full brightness display for the whole 9 hout flight with no way to change or switch off. Loos were also in serious need of updating. The soap dispenser barely worked. Staff seemed overworked and inattentive but friendly enough when I requested something basic (like a cup of water) when going by the galley. They didn't offer my toddler any friendly encouragement or the usual game to keep him occupied (we were prepared with things for him anyway) neither did I see any other cistern on the flight get any friendly attention from the staff. Meals were decent. Mains spicy and sides etc OK.The only saving grace of this Biman route (and why we decided to use it) is that it was non-stop to Sylhet so we didn't need to deal with all the... &%+!£ in Dhaka (which we would have if we'd used any other airline) and travelling between it and Sylhet with our toddler in tow.,"Reviewed February 27, 2019 ",Date of travel: January 2019,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines,2 of 5 bubbles

I am honestly baffled at how uneducated and unprofessional these people are.Our flight from Sylhet to Dhaka was cancelled and they didn't inform us until we got to the airport. Airport staff were VERY rude, no people skills whatsoever. They weighed our suitcases inaccurately in order to charge us a ridiculous amount (250,000 taka, approx £250) for an extra 12kg luggage- the staff member was clearly lying as he changed the figure as soon as a senior member of staff was lurking around behind him. Instead of compensating us for the cancelled flight with no notification, they had the cheek to ask for money for their inaccurate weighing. The tone and manner they spoke in was disgraceful, very threatening and they were actually mocking and laughing at the misery they were putting us through behind the counter. If that wasnt enough, the staff at hand luggage security in Dhaka tried to throw away my facial cleanser (worth £55) without my consent! DISGUSTING behaviour by DISGUSTING staff who aren't even worth the title of being a human.May i add, the airport security are very weak- when i was being searched by a female member of staff, she was more interested in watching Youtube on her phone, she literally just touched my arms and told me to go. What sort of security is this? I could be carrying all sorts and they would not have a single clue!I travel to Bangladesh often and love the country but the Biman airline is a DEFINITE NO for us 'foreigners'.

Captain Bangladesh ,We were taking a family vacation to see relatives in Sylhet. We were a group of six people. We checked in and boarded without a hitch and were seated towards the rear of the aircraft. Plus points were we sat in a row of six. We took off and I heard a loud noise underneath the aircraft I looked at everyone but no one seemed to be concerned. I thought it was the undercarriage and settled in. The food was served after an hour or so. Food was average for economy so no qualms. I had issues with the tv screens as some of our screens were knackered so had to bite the bullet.As this flight was direct to Sylhet it was a 10 hour flight. Downside the children didn’t get any toys so it was noisy. Anyway as we were over India and about 1 and a half hours to land we had an announcement from the captain. He announced that Heathrow airport had called and told them that they had found tyre debris of our plane on the tarmac. The plane would have to be diverted to Dhaka so that they could fix the issues. Everyone including myself was anxious thinking how are we going to land!We approached the Dhaka airport and the plane began to descend and everyone was praying. We landed without any problems whatsoever. Hooray and thank the almighty!! The plane got a new tyre and we set off after 2hours and arrived at our destination. ,"Reviewed September 16, 2018 ",Date of travel: August 2018,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines,4 of 5 bubbles

40 minute flight turns to 40 hours in transit,"I don't like giving out 1 star reviews because every experience usually has some sort of redeeming factor to it, however my experience with Bangladesh Biman was so bad I feel like a 1 star rating is too generous.I was travelling with my wife and 2 children to Dhaka from Sylhet airport on a domestic flight in order to catch a flight from Dhaka to Delhi and then from Delhi to Chennai. I booked a domestic flight from Sylhet to Dhaka to leave at 06.30am on 03/08/2018 in order for us to catch a 10:00am flight to Delhi. We arrived at the airport in good time and were checked in without any problems. The boarding pass said that the flight would board at 06:00hrs and the flight would depart at 06:30hrs. At approximately 06:00hrs a sign came up on the departures screening saying the flight was delayed and the estimated time of departure would be 07:20am. At this point it was still possible for us to connect to our onward flight. However, 07.20 came and went and it wasn’t until 07:50 that the plane arrived at the gate. The plane did not begin to board until 08:20 by which time it was looking more than likely we would miss our flights. There were no members of Biman staff available to speak to and no explanation was given for the delay. We arrived in Dhaka at approximately 09:00hrs at which point Biman staff on the tarmac were busy ferrying passengers travelling to London on to one bus whilst putting all other passengers on another bus. We did not arrive at the domestic terminal until 09:15hrs and by the time we had collected our bags and arrived at the international terminal our flight had already boarded.At Shahjalal International, I approached the Bangladesh Biman counter and attempted to speak to your representative. It was the first time in my life that I had met a person with so little compassion or empathy in my life. She did not apologise at any point for the delay, she did not at any point acknowledge the fact that the delay had resulted in us missing our flights nor did she offer any solutions. All she kept repeating was that it was not the fault of Bangladesh Biman that I had booked tickets with their airline and that I should have expected delays. Eventually, after realising that your member of staff, was in no way willing to assist me, I was forced to purchase tickets to fly to Kolkata from Dhaka at an additional expense of BDT 25,330. I was told that the earliest flight was at 19:20hrs and therefore I had to wait in the arrivals area of the terminal with my 2 children for 7 hours before check-in opened. In typical fashion the 19.20pm flight was delayed until 20:00hrs and then of course by the time we boarded it was 20:30hrs. I had to then pay for a hotel overnight in Kolkata as there were no connecting flights to Chennai and then had to purchase fresh tickets to Chennai. The arrogance of the staff member at the Bangladesh Biman desk in Dhaka was astounding, there was no reasoning with her and she was not going to even listen to the points I was making.This was the first (and last time) I flew with Bangladesh Biman and we arrived home 20 hours after the time we should have. I have complained to Bangladesh Biman, but given that they have the monopoly over flights coming in and out of Sylhet, I am sure my words will be dismissed in an equally arrogant manner as to the way I was treated in Dhaka by their representative.","Reviewed August 11, 2018 ",Date of travel: August 2018,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines,1 of 5 bubbles

The staff then suggested that I spoke with their supervisor but without giving further directions and I was left to deal with this by myself.The on-board cleanliness/hygiene & willingness to give a bit of decent service seem to deteriorate by the day.I have been a regular flyer with Biman & advocate to encourage others to fly with Biman however, I’ll have to think twice before I fly again with them after the recent appalling experience & the ordeal they have put me through; particularly the refusal to access the lounge with the mileage on card.","Reviewed June 21, 2018 ",Date of travel: June 2018,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines,1 of 5 bubbles

Avoid at any cost,Don't know where to start. Let's start with the check in. Check-in: There is no online check in system. As a family (3 year old and a year old) we had pre-booked seats. In heathrow counter when I checked in they put three of us in three different seats and said because of some regulation (Front of aeroplane loaded with cargo) they have to put as many passengers towards the rear end and it's not possible to provide the seats together not even reserved ones. They suggested to talk to crews once the flight reaches the cruising altitude. When spoke to crew they didn't want to listen and understand. Afterwards the captain of the flight had to deal with the issue. Crew members: The crew members were least helpful and don't have any customer service skills. Some old fashioned uniform with a grumpy face. They are walking and eating their food before they serve the passengers.Food: The food quality was poor and fixed menu. They don't have any vegetarian options and difficult to provide any dietary requirements. Seat comfort: The seat comfort is close to nothing. The local buses in UK have comfortable seats compared to the Biman seats. In flight entertainment: 75 % of in flight entertainment was broken. Fortunately i took my kids tablets or else the 11 hour flight would have been nightmare. The screen backside which is really hot is accessible to kids and finger can get through there. The temperature was getting either too cold or too hot within the Biman. They don't switch on the aircon before take off. There are mosquitoes are flying around in flight and biting the kids. They might have came in the flight flew from Bangladesh. I travelled in Biman after 16 years and I am a frequent flyer in different airlines. But this is probably the first and last time I will travel with Biman. The price of the tickets don't reflect the service they provide. They are not particularly any cheaper than other airlines.,"Reviewed March 26, 2018 ",Date of travel: March 2018,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines,1 of 5 bubbles
Mediocre But Acceptable,"Biman is a very basic and simple airline but you get an acceptable level of service as long as you're not expecting too much.Mired with corruption and vested interests, Biman somehow manages to provide a base service that simply exists to get you safely to your destination. We can expect no more. And you should expect no more.Some new Boeing 777 planes make the experience more palatable. Seats are comfy enough for an 9/10/11 hour flight. This also means that Biman planes are better at time-keeping and schedules are much more reliable.Food is not the best in the world of aviation but then you shouldn't expect it to be so for the economy price. Biman flight hosts and hostesses vanish after serving the food and only reappear at the next service time hours later. The flight crew are usually not in a good mood so be careful how you interact with them. In these days of political correctness and hurt feelings any raised voices or harsh words directed at them will result in massive problems for you. Don't raise your voice. Stay calm and endure. Focus on the end result that you want; a safe and hassle-free flight to Sylhet. Remember: THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO FLY DIRECT TO SYLHET FROM THE UK! We have no other choice. Don't let the flight crew's melancholy infect your trip. Leave them to wallow in their private depression. Just say 'thank you' and smile at the appropriate times.I do have some sympathy with the flight crew, however, as Sylheti Bengalis can be some of the most uncouth and uncivilised people you will ever come across. Having said that, you'll also find that Sylhetis are some of the most engaging and fascinating and fun people to spend 9 hours on a plane with. Avoid using the loos if you can. After a couple of hours the loos are unusable. Use the time to watch a movie, get some sleep and save your energy... because your REAL problems will begin as soon as you land in Sylhet! Biman personal in Sylhet and Dhaka airports are crooks in uniforms. In most countries criminals are in jail but it seems in Bangladesh they give them uniforms and salaried positions in the nations airports. Be wary and don't, don't, don't trust any of these bandits. They're not there to help you; only to hinder and obstruct you as much as possible.Once away from the banditry of the airport, you'll discover that Sylhet and Bangladesh are the most beautiful of places you can visit. The colours, the images, the noise, the sounds of the land, the juxtaposition of modernity and innovation with old and classical traditions. The indigenous, local people will welcome you with open arms and offer help and assistance where possible. Help is just a shout and a beckon away.You can be sure that the people in Biman Bangladesh Airlines and the airports DEFINITELY DO NOT represent the best of Bangladesh itself.I would recommend Biman Bangladesh Airlines for the single reason that they operate the ONLY direct flight to Sylhet from the UK. At the time of writing there is no other alternative. You simply get on the plane and 9 hour later you're in Sylhet. For that, I for one, am very grateful.","Reviewed March 26, 2018 ",Date of travel: February 2018,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines,3 of 5 bubbles
"Delays, Delays and More Delays","Was delayed by TWO HOURS for a THIRTY MINUTE journey. They never give you any updates, information or anything. I don’t think this Airline has ever NOT been delayed even when I flew the next day from Dhaka to London it was delayed again no one gave any information, you are left to your own devices wondering what the hell is going on. I will not be using this Airline ever again unfortunately. My experience has been absolutely awful especially due to the delays on my Sylhet to Dhaka flight. Also when I got off the plane I had to wait a while until the bus came to take us to our terminal (really it should have been there waiting for us) I paid extra to get to my destination quicker than a car but in the end it took me longer from start to finish and I lost a day. It’s a good job I had no other flights to catch that day otherwise I would have missed it due to the delays. I would suggest you avoid this airline at all costs.

An airline so terrible it is almost criminal.,"Avoid Biman Bangladesh Airlines if you have any other choice. Both our flights were delayed - except they weren't, technically, because the airline 'rescheduled' them without giving any notice. This exonerates them of any obligation to passengers and unfortunately may mean you are unable to make a claim on your travel insurance for expenses incurred by the delay. Ground staff were completely unhelpful and repeatedly lied to my face about the reason for delay and the length of delay. They said we had not been contacted in advance because we do not have a Bangladeshi phone number - however, booking had been made online, and an email was sent to us the day before departure inviting us to upgrade - so why not inform us via email, or through our foreign simcards, which we had entered in contact information, including the country code? We ended up having to spend 10 hours in Dhaka airport as a result and I was genuinely worried we wouldn't fly that day. I checked the small print of the T&C and Biman basically say they have no responsibility to the passengers of any kind - they can reschedule and cancel flights with no notice and no obligation to passengers. Absolutely awful experience.","Reviewed January 6, 2018 ",Date of travel: January 2018,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines,1 of 5 bubbles

Business class for £1K...can’t complain! ,"Don’t get me wrong, it is business class but not as you know it! (if you are used to other major carriers that is). It’s the only direct, albeit with a 1hr stop in Sylet (you don’t get off) flight from LHR to DAC, and for £1K and change, it’s hard to complain. The aircraft is a 777-ER I believe, seats are ample with ‘almost’ fully flat for sleeping. The food is not bad, it’s not what you would normally expect on business class, but again, it’s cheap in comparison. Media is provided in the usual 10inch or so screen in the seat in front, some modern western films but I would recommend the Bollywood ones, much more modern and better quality. Headphones are hilarious giant ear muffs that crackle lots, if you have a headphone adaptor use it with your own set, standard two pin airline affair. USB in seat for charging along but rarely works. Only complaint I have, and it’s a minor one, is that the staff do seem to give off the impression that they are doing you a favour by allowing you onto their plane! If you are a frequent visitor of Bangladesh then you get used to it and so I pay no attention, however if this is your first trip with Biman, bear with it, they are very friendly and helpful, just try to look past the time it takes for them to do anything, it does eventually get done I promise! I travel Biman on average three times a year, and I would always recommend the national carrier of Bangladesh for both work and tourist visits. Note: expect the flight to be delayed by around 2hours leaving Heathrow and also returning from Dhaka. No idea why, it’s never on time! You can get Visa on arrival quite easily now and security at Dhaka is very intensive when leaving for the UK, so prepare for a very long Security queue on the way back.

After check-in we got our boarding passes and then we made toward the boarding gate. While waiting at the boarding gate we was hoping to leave at 13:00 (3 hours delayed) but unfortunately it did not happen. We was there until 15:00 (5 hours delayed) in which I was extremely angry. The airline was 5 hours delayed and did not provide any refreshments. After boarding on the plane myself and other passengers was complaining to cabin crew to serve lunches immediately as we have not eaten anything since early morning. On return to london I tried to make a claim for compensation on 5 hours delayed but the terms and condition for flight der claim is that you either have to be travelling from EU country or the airline must be a EU airline. I and my family have suffered heavily on this airline. I can't believe I paid £3500 for 3 adult, 1 child and a toddler.

The Worlds most useless airline ,"I was due to fly back to Heathrow from Sylhet via Dhaka. My domestic flight (operated by Biman) got cancelled so they asked us to take the flight the day before from Sylhet to Dhaka. They advised that they would put us up in a hotel for the night before our international flight the day after. I was travelling with my Elderly mother and wife, my mother needs a wheelchair as she had multiple operations on her knee so she is unable to walk long distances. We got to Dhaka Airport, there was no wheelchair available for my mum when we got there so I had to find someone myself to assist us and being Bangladesh everything comes at a price so I had to pay. Eventually we found out that we had to take multiple minivans along with other passengers to the hotel. The wheelchair advisor just left us outside the airport, there was no guidance from the Biman representative. I struggled to get my mother on to the vehicle as it was crammed with people, it was like being in a tin of sardines. The next day it was the same coming back to Dhaka Airport. We also got stopped by the police as our minivan driver did not have the proper paper work to drive (police man were paid off by the driver so he let us continue). When we got to the airport we were dumped outside again without any guidance. We managed to find the Biman transfers desk and I also managed to find a decent wheelchair assistant to help my mother. The flight was then delayed by 5 hours, there was no apology from Biman, there was no refreshment vouchers for the inconvenience.  Most of the passengers behave like animals on the flight, they have no common courtesy for fellow human beings. No respect for the flight attendants and absolutely no manners.The only thing good about the flight was there was no turbulence.The only reason people take Biman is due to the fact that it goes direct to Sylhet. I would recommend traveling with any middle eastern airline to Dhaka if you are going on a holiday. Thank you Biman for the worst airline experience ever. You never fail to disappoint.

Gradual Improvements - but must do better if they really aree to be taken seriously as a global airline.,"It would be fair to say that Bangladesh Biman are trying to make the sort of improvements which are needed if they are to attract a more diverse passenger group and shake off their reputation for delays and poor customer service. My flight out from LHR left 30 mins late although did arrive on time in Dhaka, via Sylhet, and overall the attitude and performance of the cabin crew were good. The return journey was quite the opposite, with delayed flight and no apology or clear announcements - disinterested cabin staff and unattractive menu. Disappointing that they cannot organise priority boarding for business class passengers. Key problem for Biman is they they simply cannot provide consistency or continuity in standards and your never entirely sure or confident about what quality and standard of journey it will prove to be. They really must have a more corporate strategy if they are ever to deliver a comparable brand and service to most other flying in/out of Dhaka. One of its strong points are the direct flight to/from LHR and good value for money on a business/executive class ticket.","Reviewed July 8, 2017 ",Date of travel: June 2017,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines,3 of 5 bubbles

The flight attendants did their best to give a good service. There was a sincere effort and I for one appreciated that. The food was regional with a choices. I am not sure which particular aircraft model we flew but the seats didnt recline as much as I would have wanted it to. For the difference in fare from Economy the quality of seats did nnot justify the fare. I would have been happier if the fare was 15% less closer to what the private sector Bangladeshi carriers charge.I would have rated 'very good' but the fare pricing reduces them to a lower value for many and therefore Average - 3 star.,"Reviewed July 2, 2017 ",Date of travel: May 2017,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines,3 of 5 bubbles

Great Pilots,"Biman is the only flight that runs direct flight from London to Bangladesh. It takes only 10 - 12 hours to reach Dhaka. I have used Biman’s International flights many times.First of all I love the take-off and landing of Biman, it is so smooth. All the Boeings are great but once due to some issues they have rented Turkish airlines and I think the size was a bit smaller than our Boeings, where at the end hours I had breathing issues. I have never called the flight attendants for any issues but all of them were fine with their regular duties.Now the bad sides - as a flight I could not find any issues but the main problems are with ourselves. We the Bangladeshi people are so manner less and stupid.People are smoking in the toilets and risking our lives, attendants are running after them. Passengers are ready with their luggages during the time of landing, they are not listening and not seating and taking out their cabin luggages what can cause serious accidents. Even after landing they start fighting that who can get off first...is it a local bus or what? That is why I always keep seated and get off when all these passengers in a hurry get off first. Our respected passengers shout for food, ask for medicines, block the alleys, and make the toilets dirty like hell. There is a big problem with the people who work for Biman. I was in Bangladesh and needed to change the date of my return flight with the mentioned fine but the officers said there is nothing left. After some requests they asked bribe and offer seats. I have to bribe them because I have to go back to London. But the funny thing is the flight was not full at all and they lied about the seats.Lastly, comfort at some points depend on you. I like to book 3 seats in a row (they have offers) though we are two. Most of the times the back seat TV does not work and you can keep some movies in your gadgets.

The spacious seats are very comfortable, especially in the newest planes. Passenger seats and toilets are spotlessly clean. The in-flight entertainment is on par with the best airlines in the world with plentiful touch screens everywhere – side of the seat, front of the seat and giant screens in the front aisle, which allow you to track the progress of the flight very precisely and in great detail. Biman has a good collection of Bengali films and foreign movies in its catalog. It is an excellent airline that is budget friendly and comfortable.I flew Dhaka to Dubai and it was a surprisingly good experience overall. As with all airlines from South Asia, the only problem was the large numbers of mostly uneducated menial workers (self-loading freight) that usually fill the lowest Economy seats and fly regularly to the Middle East and elsewhere. Usually they are brash and don’t miss an opportunity to be noisy, rude and loud. In order to avoid such ruckus when flying with Biman, it is best to fly Premium Economy class (also called Economy Flexible class) or choose any of the Business classes.

This route has potential: Kolkata-Yangon,"My review is just about the CCU-RGN route with a plane change at Dhaka. By far, this is the most economical and efficient service/route through which you can reach Myanmar from India. Hence, I think that the route has potential since Myanmar should get a lot of Indian tourists after it has opened up.There were delays in the Kolkata-Dhaka and the Yangon-Dhaka segments. But they did deliberately delay the connecting flights at Dhaka such that passengers do not get stranded. This deliberate delay suited us more than fine. We paid about 14500 INR for each round ticket between Kolkata and Yangon. Not cheap (compared to European no frills airlines for the distance), but considerably cheaper than competition like Air India.Food was okay - I no longer look at quantity/quality parameters for food in economy flights on most airlines in the world. Who provides great food in such flights.","Reviewed September 27, 2016 ",Date of travel: July 2016,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines,4 of 5 bubbles
Biman - decent budget airline for a short trip,"This was a short flight (2 hours) and a small plane (propeller) so there was no entertainment. Bring your own if you need it. Check-in and boarding were no problem. It actually went quite fast I thought. The box lunch was OK - appetizer (samosa type thing), cheese or chicken sandwich, cake, apple, water. My window was particularly dirty as my camera could only focus on the dirt and not the landscape outside. There was an incident concerning a 'dignitary' who was about to board and wanted the first row instead of his assigned seat in row two. However, someone was already in row one and refused to move. The flight attendant even said the passenger was in the wrong seat when clearly (I saw it) he had the boarding pass for the seat he was in. The dignitary had to sit in row two. This was poorly handled by Biman Airlines although I'm sure they were under pressure from the dignitary. Special treatment for all or for none! Other than that, Biman is a decent budget airline in my opinion.","Reviewed September 27, 2016 ",Date of travel: September 2016,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines,3 of 5 bubbles

As I had not booked a return to london with any airline I thought i would give Biman a try as i last used them about 8 years ago.Lets start with groundstaff. Anyone with a biman logo on their top is useless. Any questions asked i was normally passed onto someone else equally clueless.Plane take off was delayed. No reason given, staff just blanking passengers questions. When we did eventually manage to get the plane off the ground we was given lunch consisting of bland chicken, rice and a little salad bowl. The flight was for 10 hours. Passengers given lunch and nothing else until 2 hours before landing. Tge snack in question contains a meat pate soaked in oil and a coupleof pakoras.Really not worththe effort.Air stewardesses have this air of arrogance about them.

Finaly through airport staff managed to approach staff of Biman Bangladesh who were clueless and did not bother to assist my parents who are senior citizens. Flight arrived at 7:30pm and yet till almost midnight they were running from one desk to another to get assistance. Through assurance from airport manager they went to a hotel for rest for the night. Next morning they almost missed their domestic flight but managed to catch the same. Finally after 2 days managed to get in touch with Biman Bangladesh officer who was not very helpful but curtly informed that they will send the luggage. After 4 days luggage was finally received.

My worst flight,"In Bangkok I was impressed with the service they were all kind to me and treated me with respect. Then I got to Bangladesh and had a layover. The people in Biman treated me with indifference and then overcharged me for my visa and my hotel, which on each of them they said they would take care of. However the price I paid more for the visa was more than the actual visa, (even the receipt he gave me had a lower price on it) and the hotel was outrageously expensive, especially considering that it was a bug infested hotel (bed bugs, mosquitos and cockroaches). The next day I found myself dealing with indifferent Biman agents. (They treated me with indifference however some individuals from other countries they were downright rude to.) On arrival in Kathmandu we were just flying in circles and circles, which I guess is common for Kathmandu, however there was no announcement made as to why. After 20 min of flying in circles I asked the flight attendant what was going on. She just smiled and said, ""Why would be flying in circles, and walked away."" At that point I thought there was major problems with the plane, but we eventually landed. The landing was the roughest landing I ever had. I heard several people say ""I think there is a problem"". When we stopped there was an applause, we survived. The problem wasn't flying in circles, or the rough landing. The problem was the lack of communication so that we had no idea what was going on.Between corruption of the Biman agents in Bangladesh and the awful plane ride, I will not be flying with Biman again.","Reviewed July 3, 2016 ",Date of travel: July 2016,Biman_Bangladesh_Airlines,1 of 5 bubbles

Very short flight ,"This was my 10th time traveling to Kolkata but first time with US Bangla airlines. Dhaka to Kolkata is just a 30 minutes flight. There is nothing much to say though, they offer a complementary snack box which comes with a mini chicken burger, a cupcake and a 250 ml of mineral water. Not bad for a 30 minutes flight. There are other Indian airlines in this route, they don't give these complimentary meals. On my return leg from Kolkata to Dhaka, the snack box came with chicken sandwich and a piece of cake. One thing I didn't like is, their window glass was very dirty, it was very difficult to see outside. I would love to travel with US Bangla airline again.

Scam you for money,"Terrible service by US bangla hostess when connecting to Sylhet from Dhaka. They look at international travellers and see an opportunity to make money from them. Got charged for extra kilo, and also lied by increasing the total amount so they can take more off you. The lady at the desk was very rude and had her hunch men with her making you feel uncomfortable. When you try and express your feelings, they don't want to hear it. You try to argue your case, but they continue to harass you until you give in. This is not good for vulnerable passengers who have health conditions that get worse in situations like this. The staff were not very helpful or understanding, just looking out for themselves on how to make extra pocket money. I ended giving the only bit of cash I had, short of a few taka which they happily took and I received no receipt or nothing so clearly they will just split this amongst themselves.

Highly Satisfied,"I am highly satisfied with the service of the airlines both in flight & grounds stuffs at Kolkata Airport. We were late due to traffic for the flight. Then they quickly checked us in although we crossed the closing time, then they rushed us to the aircraft as quickly as possible. A power bank was found on my checkin luggage so I have to stay back at airport. The stuffs helped me out in all the ways they can to sort the problem & catch the next flight. My full family flew back but i stayed but the crews in the flight was apologizing to my mom for not flying me back home & also were taking a good care of my mom. They also helped my mom with the baggage after landing at Dhaka airport. I came back on the next flight the cabin service is excellent & the timings for this route is the best. the aircraft is a B737-800 new one & also its very cleaned. For me the bst part about US Bangla is that they take a good care of my mom.

Very disappointing,"The company needs a LOT of work to improve. I bought 2 tickets using my card and had to cancel one of the tickets as my friend was unable to travel with me. The company Support Line is nearly impossible to get to and once I did get through,they asked me to go to their office to pick up the money. So I did, during my lunch hour. (Side note, the guard outside the office was bullying a street dog WITH A STICK and once I protested he started yelling at me. I complained to the customer service people about him but of course I do not believe that he was reprimanded as they found the entire thing to be quite funny).Anyways, it turned out that my entire trip to the office was a waste of time as they refund card transactions ONLY through online transfers, which is fine, EXCEPT THEY DID NOT TELL ME THIS ON THE PHONE. So I followed their protocol, sent an email requesting a refund and called them to check that they did indeed receive my email. They replied saying that my money will be refunded in 10-15 working days. This was August 2016 (Today is September 28, 2016- just to clarify). I am still to receive this refund and when I called to follow up, (AGAIN, TERRIBLY DIFFICULT TO GET THROUGH) they gave me 3 different numbers to call. After going round in this circle, I finally was able to get through to someone who offered to help. He then said that the company never received my email. When I told him of my confirmation email, his response was, ""Oh right.... Um. Sorry madam your request seems to have been overlooked. We will attend to it immediately"". This was a 10 days back.

Another shoddy experience flying Regent,"Regent's managed to do it again -- another late flight without any rational explanation (the boarding agent tried to explain ""the weather in Dhaka is not so good,"" while Google tells me it's 78 degrees there and partially cloudy; the more likely explanation is that either the pilot overslept or they've held the plane because some upper-middle class family with a friend in the Regent office is running late).When I first arrived in Bangladesh six years ago, Regent used to be exceptionally reliable with both domestic and international flights, a welcome change from the wholly indifferent customer service of Bangladeshi airlines like Biman. In the past three years, whether through a change in management or just someone in charge allowing things to go steadily downhill, I have just come to expect 30 - 60 minute delays for 45-minute long domestic flights and an hour or more for international flights. My three hour flight to Bangkok today is now approaching two hours of delays with no announcements and likely no justifiable reason.","Reviewed April 28, 2018 ",Date of travel: April 2018,Regent_Airways,2 of 5 bubbles

Average experience nothing over the expectation,"Traveled twice in 2 months. Went to Chittagong from Bangkok in December & returned in January. I have flown with the airline in the domestic routes couple of times in the past. First time I have flown in an international route due to the fact that other than Thai Smile only Regent operates direct flights to CGP (Chittagong) from Bangkok. Flight to Chittagong was pretty decent. There was a delay at the runway, only because there were too many flights waiting to take-off. The 737-700 aircraft was in a pretty good condition from it's outlook. Inside it was somewhat hot. The aircon was unable to provide enough coolness. People were sweating on their seat as the plane waited in the queue to take-off. However, the cabin crew assured us that the aircon will be fine as soon we get airborne! Seats were pretty comfy but not much legroom. You can't expect to have ample legroom in a 737. Liked the interior. Just requires some attention to cleanliness but nothing big.Take-off and landing was smooth. Traditional Bangladeshi food was provided. One thing I have noticed in my both flights, the male flight attendants do not smile at all. Especially for one them I felt like he hates his job! This obviously gave me a bad impression about their cabin service. Out of 4 cabin crew I came to see in my both flights, only one smiled and tried to give a good service. It's not just me, even my wife felt the same. No inflight entertainment. I wouldn't mind as this was just about 2 hours flight. Return flight experience was also pretty much same except the ground service we received is below standard. We had to walk to the Tarmac carrying our hand luggage and there were no lifts in Shah Amanat International Airport to go down to the tarmac from the waiting area at the 1st floor. We had to take the stairs and we had an old lady walking in front us who was struggling to walk down the stair case. No help offered to her from Regent whatsoever. As it was a narrow staircase it took her good 5 minutes to walk down the staircase and people were lining behind her. Felt sorry for her trouble. Same aircon problem in the return flight and food scrap found in the fold up meal tray. To our surprise ""Nasi Goreng"" was provided in meal! While landing at Bangkok, seems like the pilot was in rush to land. Took several sharp turns and the landing was hard. I wouldn't mind flying with Regent again but the attitude of the cabin crew does gives a negative impression. If you want to compete with the other airlines in the region you must improve your cabin service and bring the international standard. I would recommend to fly with Regent but don't expect too much as this is a small airline still trying to strengthen it's feet in the industry.","Reviewed March 18, 2018 ",Date of travel: December 2017,Regent_Airways,3 of 5 bubbles

"For a first-time traveller, pretty good!","I flew Regent for my first trip to Bangladesh, from Chittagong to Dhaka. Seeing as it was the most efficient and (being a solo female traveller), safest way to get back to the capital, I booked a flight despite some initial reservations. I had a better than expected experience - the seats were comfortable, the flight was smooth and everything really went as planned. One tip for anyone travelling this route - try to travel light as you'll have to walk on the tarmac to get to the plane and climb up. Food-wise, I requested vegetarian food, but didn't get that. So please, any travellers intending to fly domestically, ensure that you have something to eat before flying.

Great Value for money but inconsistent cabin service brings down the rating. ,"I regularly fly this airline to Singapore. Have done 4 return trips in the last three months or so.

The check in for departure at SATS Lounge in Singapore is a delight and deserves an “excellent.

It is inconsistent (some of them are very good) and the cabin crew needs further training. They couldn’t find a place to hang my jacket and the result after a four hour flight was a crumpled jacket which needed immediate laundry service at the hotel for me to wear it to the meeting.

It would have been better to walk,"Where to begin. Ok, well if you not fussed about a lack of customer service, a void of airline representatives; delays based on fictitious weather conditions – (apparently the information on Apple iPhone is made up) then this is the airline for you. Scheduling is only a mere guideline for this airline, yes the gate does open at 23:00 but actually the plane won’t be here for another 2 hours. But we will make this into a little game - whereby we won’t actually tell you any of this information so that you can entertain yourself by running around the airport trying to find it out. Bonus points if you can find one of our representatives. Oh, so you get on the plane (eventually) and make yourself comfortable. Before putting on your seat belt, make sure you roll up the inflight magazine and take swipes at the swarm of mosquitos on board (they were delayed as well but I don’t think they will be compelled to write a review) If you manage to nab a few before take-off, you can continue to entertain yourself for the duration of the flight by gunning for the rest.

"Smooth journey, good flights","Novo air is probably the best private airline in Bangladesh. Service is good, and have not had any bad experience ever. The crew are very polite and helpful, and the food is good for a short trip (eggs, wraps, chocolate and water). I have mostly flown DAC-CXB so not sure about other routes, but I have similar expectations. They are professionals.","Reviewed December 24, 2018 ",Date of travel: November 2018,NOVOAIR,5 of 5 bubbles

NOVOAIR- An young private airline of Bangladesh,"NOVOAIR- a private Airline of Bangladesh started operation only 2/3 years ago but within this short span of time, the airline has expanded their operation to almost all domestic destinations of Bangladesh and a few international destinations also.The Aircraft ATR-72- 600 series was spotlessly clean. The flight from Rajshahi to Dhaka is of short duration (40 mins). However, the flight was very smooth. The crews were very helpful. Amazingly, the airfare was only USD 35/=( oneway). A good bargain indeed!","Reviewed December 1, 2018 ",Date of travel: September 2018,NOVOAIR,3 of 5 bubbles

Good choice for comfort,"Always timely boarding call, A/C works perfectly, no complain about customer service . Only problem the airlines often merge scheduled Flight with another Flight.
