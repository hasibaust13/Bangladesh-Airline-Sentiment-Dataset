The idea was to provide them with an aisle seat and to be near a toilet to avoid any accidents on the plane that would inconvenience other passengers. The flight was delayed, they were made to sit in the middle in cramped conditions, knee to knee seats causing my parents to suffer with breathing and other conditions.

"""return flight was a nightmare""",I Maslan,United Kingdom,17th July 2019," My husband and I travel every year in BB during winter from Heathrow Airport, London as its the only airline which flies almost direct to Dhaka. We have usually enjoyed out flights due to the service of the young cabin staff. However this time we went again in June 2019 to attend a wedding. The return flight from Dhaka to London was a nightmare on 30 June 2019. I was in seat 2J. The stewardesses were very rude and unhelpful and were busy taking selfies with a rude passenger in the front row (Aisle seat) on our side. He was using his telephone continuously during takeoff and as the cabin staff did not do anything, my husband and I complained to the cabin staff to stop him without success. They appeared to be in awe of that male passenger. The main dishes were spicy and substandard as usual so I requested for sandwiches which was never a problem in previous flights. They ignored my request and so I waited for the cheese, crackers and fruit trolley. They passed us by asking if we wanted any drinks. I was starving in Business Class! My husband requested one of the stewardesses to bring cheese, crackers and fruit for me. She brought thick slices of cheese and some fruit without crackers and practically placed the plates with a bang in front of me. Try eating thick slices of cheese without a knife and crackers!!!! They did not serve any thing else after the so called lunch on a 13 hour flight in Business Class. My husband asked for some food as we were both hungry and we were given some stale cupcakes which we could not eat. Finally they brought some really inedible food before we landed. Thank God we had a real good meal waiting for us at home. This is the service in Bangladesh Biman in Business Class. There is no first class. We only travel in BB as we have no choice.

"""seat comfort is close to nothing""",K Amir,United Kingdom,28th March 2018,London to Sylhet. Check-in: There is no online check in system. As a family (with young children) we had pre-booked seats. At the Heathrow counter when I checked in they put three of us in three different seats and said because of some regulation (Front of aeroplane loaded with cargo) they have to put as many passengers towards the rear end and it's not possible to provide the seats together not even reserved ones. They suggested to talk to crew once the flight reaches the cruising altitude. When spoke to crew they didn't want to listen and understand. The crew members were least helpful and don't have any customer service skills. They are walking and eating their food before they serve the passengers. The food quality was poor and fixed menu. They don't have any vegetarian options and difficult to provide any dietary requirements. The seat comfort is close to nothing. The local buses in UK have comfortable seats compared to the Biman seats. 75% of inflight entertainment was broken. Fortunately I took my kids tablets or else the 11 hour flight would have been nightmare. There is no phone charging facility or wifi to purchase. The temperature was getting either too cold or too hot. They don't switch on the aircon before take off. I travelled with Biman after 16 years and I am a frequent flyer in different airlines.

"""Much more needs to be done""",Riaz Osmani,United Kingdom,9th September 2017," Biman charges half of what renowned carriers charge for round trip Business Class fares between London and Dhaka through their hubs. Keeping that in mind and the fact that there is no change of aircraft required for this trip by Biman, you get a decent offering overall. B777-300ER aircraft is my favourite. Business Class cabin with 35 angle flat seats in a 2-3-2 configuration. Large PTVs with AVOD in Bangla, Hindi and English. Bilingual flight tracker provided. Some audio with Indian Classical Music would complete the package which included games for children. Decent headphones, blankets and pillows. Amenity kit consisted of eye shades and socks only. Plenty of food choices. Second service was as substantial as the first. However, presentation of the meal service was awful. FAs needed to remove all plastic and foil wraps from serving dishes, and neatly arrange the meal tray before bringing it to the passengers. Being a dry airline, Biman needed to excel in its soft drinks service. Fruit juices of very poor quality and quantity. I expect larger glasses with bigger servings and refills without having to ask. Orange should taste like freshly squeezed in Business Class. Regular black tea served was of very poor quality. FA should never simply dish out coke and sprite cans to Business Class passengers. Such drinks should be served in glasses (with optional ice) brought from the galley. FAs consisted of two ladies and two gentlemen (one being the purser). The ladies did all the work while the men loitered around the galley. The female FAs thus struggled to perform their duties and then go above and beyond with any personal touches like asking about extra drinks or food. Such personal touches were completely missing. The ladies looked fantastic in their sari uniforms. The men had poor personal grooming with tired looking outfits. Male FAs need to have fresh new South Asian inspired uniforms and training in better grooming and appearance. Lounge access was provided at the beginning of both trips. Mildly scented hot towel and newspaper provided upon taking seats. Juice provided to welcome everyone. The airline caters quite well to a Bangladeshi clientele.

Went through security and it's a mob-scene at the gates. Many flights leaving at the same time (early afternoon) so it was hot and crowded. Boarded by bus to the plane and welcomed by the flight attendants graciously. Excellent service - one of the best flights ever. Row 1 A/B - massive amounts of leg-room on a leased 737-800. FA's apologized as their own 737-800s have in-seat video, but we didn't mind. The service from boarding to deplaning was second to none. We were the only passengers in Business. Take off gave amazing views of Kathmandu, and to our luck the route took us along the Himalays and we had fantastic views of Mt. Everest!  Meal was delicious served on china with plentiful drinks provided. The FA's talked with us about what to see in Dhaka on our short visit there and kept us entertained on the flight.

The Biman agents at the check in was really rude. Their comment was ""Biman is always late, I don't understand why other airlines gives us as connecting flight."" Well that's because Biman never posts their delayed time online. If Biman is always late, I don't understand why not just adjust the schedule. There was an unannounced transit of an hour in Sylhet, where the cleaning crew stayed cleaning with vacuum while the passengers were on the plane. Put the blankets in a garbage bag and shoved the bag in the washroom floor with their feet. The inflight food and entertainment was terrible.

"""flight in Business Class was average""",C Nelson,Bangladesh,14th December 2016," My flight from Dhaka to Thailand in Business Class was average. I like travelling by Biman but maybe that is because I haven't experienced delays as much and I was lucky that way. However, I wouldn't pay to be on Biman's Business Class. This flight was bought for me so I did not care too much, but for those of you who are considering paying for Business Class, please consider the following points: 1) You will not enjoy the in-flight entertainment system that they have. I played 'Dolly Parton' the whole flight as I couldn't find a better option. 2) The interior of the cabin (starting from the lounge) will make you feel like you have traveled back in time to the 70s. Even the china used for the flight somehow feels very old and not in a classy vintage way. 3) The food was very average. The prawn salad tasted bland. Whoever the chef was did not do a good job with it. They could have done a better menu. The food served in economy class on my way back from Thailand tasted much much better. 4) The hot towels served during the flight lacked moisture. They just handed out warm dry towels which was pointless. Luckily, it was a short flight and being a clear day, I could look down and enjoy the sight below.

I also used Biman for my returning flight and that was also good apart from the flight being 15 minutes late.,,Das 8 Q400,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dhaka to Kolkata,November 2015,3.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,yes,3.0,,
"""Boeing 777-200 was so bad""",M Islam,United Kingdom,13th November 2015,"Very disappointed with the Biman Bangladesh Airlines Boeing 777-200 it was so bad. It was like you go back to the 70's. I have travelled with Biman previously with the newer Boeing 777-300 and that was so much better experience. This experience was bad - seats were cramped zero entertainment and for 10 hours it was very painful not worth money you pay. Return trip was even worse as previously they kept you in hotel for one night in Dhaka, than fly next morning, but now you have to go Sylhet airport for 3am stop at Dhaka, wait there 4 or 5 hours than fly UK. When booking flights make sure you get Boeing 777-300. Only plus side 40 kg luggage",,Boeing 777-200,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,London to Syhlet,September 2015,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,yes,3.0,1.0,1.0
"""would consider flying again""","1 reviews



Habib Choudhury",United Kingdom,13th November 2015,"The planes used by Biman Bangladesh from London to Sylhet and return via Dhaka were clean and cabin in good condition. I believe the planes used for the journey were Boeing 777-300ER. The  the Inflight Entertainment has a 12"" screen, with Hollywood and Bollywood Movies, games, flight maps and other information. The seats in economy were comfortable and included foot rests and neck support, and the inflight magazine was also good. Food The food served was not to the standard of Emirates or other similar airlines, but still to a good standard. The food consisted of two main meals, cold drink and hot drink. Cabin crew were attentive and smiling and spoke fluent English. They cleared trays promptly and responded to requests promptly. They even brought my group of travellers masala (desi) tea's upon request. There is improvement needed in the way that they serve food. During the main meal serving times, there are 3 option ie Chicken, Lamb and Fish, however this is not advertised anywhere and nor is there a menu card offered, which is offered by other airlines. The only reason I found out was because I enquired about the options, otherwise cabin crew simply serve the dish they hold in their trolley!  Also the juices served are not good quality and full of sugar. I would consider flying again with Biman, provided they are able to keep up the quality.",,Boeing 777-300ER,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dhaka to London,November 2015,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes,4.0,4.0,

"""there are still negatives with Biman""",Azmol Hussain,United Kingdom,9th September 2015,"First flight with Biman Bangladesh Airlines after almost ten years of not flying with them due to terrible planes and flight scehdules. Check in at Heathrow was chaotic as there were many travellers with families and overweight luggage. Biman don't have their own lounge but use Gulf Air at Heathrow. worth paying 30 pound surcharge for some peace and relaxing. New plane had good seats and clean interior. Inflight entertainment is okay, not a great selection of movies of videos but sufficient. Meals were adequate though nothing special and certainly not on par with the Emirates or Qatar Airways. Biman seems to have made some improvements from what it was, but there are still negatives. Cabin crew really need to smile more and be friendly, they seem disengaged as if they don't like their jobs. Selection of soft drinks is very poor - asked for coke and not available, asked for pineapple juice again not available. They do not offer drinks during flights or pre take off. They don't provide hot towels and you have to ask for blankets.",,B777 -300ER,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Sylhet,April 2015,4.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,yes,3.0,3.0,

Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Joanna Wittekoek,Netherlands,26th August 2015,"I booked the Biman Bangladesh Airlines ticket online which was easy and the site worked fine. Check in was disappointing becasue they forgot me to charge an extra tax of 500 taka and then I needed to take my luggage and had go to a counter to pay.  Reached Yangon on time. No entertainment, but for a 2 hour flight I can entertain myself. Although it was Ramadan, we got water and a snack.

Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,S Alam,Singapore,20th May 2015,Took two flights Singapore to Dhaka and Dhaka to Chittagong. Both flights were on time. Singapore - Dhaka was served by the B737. Those are really old aircraft with no EFE. Dhaka to Chittagong was 777. Food was ok cabin crews were also nice.

Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Mohammad Makshumul Hoque,United Arab Emirates,10th May 2015,I traveled on April 30 2015. I took 2 flights on the same day - one international from Kuala Lumpur to Dhaka and the other is domestic from Dhaka to Chittagong. Amazingly both the flights were perfectly on time. In fact both of those did not even slipped 10 minutes. I heard that Biman Bangladesh improved a lot in terms of schedule service inflight audio visual entertainment but the experience was beyond expectations. A good number of recent Hollywood movies classic English Hindi and Bengali films were available on international flight with no extra charge. Complementary food was excellent. Ticket price was far lower than other available flights. Seats were neat. Leg room was very good.

While going to KTM the flight was almost vacant. Cabin crews behaviour was very good and co-operative. Foods was quite tasty but cold. There was no IFE system and no magazines/newspapers were provided. Return flight was also quite good. No delay occured. Food was good but lack of In-flight entertainment.

Very poor airline and we are all disappointed. We were family of 7. Flight was delayed by 2 hours from LHR. Cabin crew were rude with no smiles at all. Very miserable and unprofessional. Biman has purchased a Boeing 777 er but seriously they need to recruit new cabin crew. Food was ok nothing special. Drinks were served with no ice very little food served for a 10 hours flight.

Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Haq Tanzirul,United Kingdom,28th August 2014,Flew from Heathrow to Dhaka on 6th July 2014. Checking-in at Heathrow Terminal 4 was an unusual experience for me. Although checking-in was relatively quick but the chaos/arguments amongst the passengers and ushering staff didn't go unnoticed. No niceties. This chaos and disorganisation continued during the boarding. Take off delayed but that was of no fault of the airline. Aircraft Boeing 777-/300 ER was fine. In-flight food was simple usual Asian curry and rice and not much to say about that. Cabin crews didn't seem very happy. They portrayed the image of doing a job rather than serving customers with a smile. Full of used toilet tissues on the toilet floor and on one occasion I found no toilet paper at all. Landed at Sylhet International Airport. The airport is a joke for international standards. Passengers for Sylhet got off and few cleaners boarded and followed by few domestic and international passengers bound for Dhaka. Biman then took off for Dhaka (a 20 minutes flight). The captain didn't even bother to announce anything! Confusion again after landing at Dhaka airport. Which passengers will use which door! No organisation no clear instructions no communications between crews. They just stood by the door arms folded. Returned to London Heathrow on 13th August in business class wasn't that bad. This time the cabin crew were more welcoming. Take off was delayed 45 minutes and landed at Heathrow at 4.05 instead of 3.30.,,,,Business Class,,,4.0,2.0,,3.0,no,2.0,3.0,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Burgess Ian,United Kingdom,21st April 2014,"We have just returned from a 2 week trip to Dhaka. 5th April LHR-DAC delayed 3 hours. When a crew was finally aboard the lack of discipline amongst the passengers scrambling to get on as if it was going to depart without them delayed the fight still further. On this flight the cabin crew were fairly miserable but not as bad as some we have seen. The cabin lights which are normally dimmed for take off were not switched on again for more than half an hour into the flight. IFE was not switched on until around 1 hour into the flight - why I cannot understand. Of course the scheduled turnaround in ZYL for onward to DAC was a joke in terms of timing as around 400 people trooped slowly off with their children and around another 300 trooped in for onward connections. Arrived in DAC about 4 hours overdue. Return flight direct DAC-LHR started with a drama. Arrived DAC to check in and were met by a check-in desk operator who seemed puzzled and asked us to wait as there was a problem. After 15-20 minutes of 3-4 check in desk staff discussing this animatedly over a console we were approached by a more senior check in operator who bluntly told us ""You are not on this flight"". Eventually a younger member of the group pointed out to them that we were not stand-by passengers and that we had a confirmed booking. However by this time someone had reallocated our seats. Eventually we received boarding passes. Flight was on time and had a newly recruited crew who were helpful smiled and even chatted. This flight DAC-LHR had a 12 year old allocated to the exit row 6 on one side of the cabin and a 6 year old and an elderly overweight lady in the equivalent row on the other side - more chaos for the cabin crew to sort out after boarding. If this airline wants to survive it needs to drag itself into the 21st century and stop running a Cattle Class service with updated training in customer services and a bit of humanity - especially the ground crews.",,,,Economy Class,,,4.0,3.0,,3.0,no,3.0,2.0,

Outbound flight LHR-ZYL departed 10 mins early. Aircraft was Biman's 3rd new Boeing 777 300ER (S2 AHM / Akash Prodeep) which was only 1 month old and was completely fresh inside out. Colour of the seats was a bit dreary but was comfortable with plenty of legroom. Staff were nice and friendly but a some of them need to smile a bit more. Food was excellent. Inbound flight from ZYL to DAC was delayed by 2 hours. Plane was in good nick which was Bimans first B777 (Palki). DAC-LHR was Bimans 2nd Boeing (Arun Alo) which was also pretty much clean until a few hours in to the flight were the toilets became a mess. I would definitely fly with Biman again when I travel to Bangladesh as it only takes 9.5 hours rather than 15 hrs should I have used another airline which requires changing aircraft's.,,,,Economy Class,,,5.0,5.0,,5.0,yes,5.0,3.0,

Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Chowdhury Didar,New Zealand,15th November 2013,Flew from Dhaka to London in October with new Boeing 777 on business class. To be honest wasn't that bad but they do need to look after their Business class passengers a bit more. Plane was new and entertainment was alright most movies are outdated by least by 6+ months. Foods were okay just to fill you up I found Qatar Economy food even better then Biman Business class. A lot of leg room only thing I hated was when the announcement was made for economy class not to do this and that it was broadcast throughout the plane.

Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,P J Trebuchet,United Arab Emirates,29th August 2013,DAC-DXB August 18th. Shockingly expensive for quite poor product. Biman Business Class is without a doubt the most affordable upgrade all over the world (USD 400 for one way ) however you get what you pay and it's evident that such a service is less than EK economy class which was USD 60 cheaper: poor old and tired lounge at Dhaka airport not less old and tired Airbus A310 as an equipment (which was continuing to Rome afterwards). No IFE on board cheesy breakfast served (burnt fried egg cold kangee strange chicken sausage and sautéed mushroom tasting like sponge) and no espresso coffee available. Rude and unprofessional Bengali cabin crew. Definitely fly Emirates on DAC-DXB route.,,,,Business Class,,,2.0,1.0,,1.0,no,2.0,1.0,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Shane Walker,Bangladesh,31st May 2013,Due to no seats being available with Singapore Airlines I unfortunately had to fly from Singapore to Dhaka with Biman and so I at least booked Business Class. Flight delayed almost 4 hours without explanation and very little communication from ground crew. Flight crew were reasonably attentive but they really do need to learn to smile. The food was OK but certainly not Business Class standards and they had a very limited selection of drinks and on-board entertainment (not everyone wants to watch Bollywood movies and the screens were too small). The A310 aircraft was reasonably clean but really starting to show it's age. The toilets were a mess by the end of the flight even though it was less than 5 hours duration. Really the only good point was the price i.e. Business Class ticket was half the price of an Economy ticket with Singapore Airlines. I certainly won't be flying Biman again unless I have no other choice.,,,,Business Class,,,3.0,2.0,,3.0,no,1.0,1.0,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,M Ahmed,United Kingdom,5th May 2013,Heathrow - Sylhet.

Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,-,,1st November 2007,"CCU-DAC-CCU. My flight to Dhaka was scheduled for 1930 hrs and since I was connecting from an Indian domestic flight I had arrived at Calcutta Airport at noon time. Sitting in the lobby of the international terminal I received a phone call from Biman informing me the flight would be delayed until 2230 (although the departure information board right above me was still showing ""Scheduled""). To their credit BG offered free dinner. We finally departed 2330 i.e. 4 hours late. Can't understand why an airline whose main base is only 40 minutes flying time away cannot rearrange its planes to avoid a 4-hour delay. Returning four days later flight was on time but check-in was extremely slow due to repeated incursions by uniformed staff holding bundles of tickets and passports of pax who were not in the queue. When I finally complained the staff member in question told me that he was actually checking in himself ""as crew"" and therefore had priority. Further questions revealed that he was not operating crew and simply felt that paying passengers come last in the scheme of things. BG have a lot of customer service training to do.",,,,,,,,,,,no,,,

Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,-,,24th April 2007,I was travelling with my three children aged 20 months 3 years old an 8 year old and my mother from Heathrow. My flight was for 3pm but was delayed until 9pm. My return flight from Shylet was for 10.40am and was then delayed to 3.00pm. Once we arrived in Dhaka the flight was for 2.00am but then delayed again for the following morning but there was no time given. This carried on for the next 5days. No information was given throughout these days and I was running out of money as I had two children on nappies I did not have enough clothes or enough nappies. I asked for nappies and they supplied me with 6 pieces of nappies after 8hrs.Two of my children were due back for school and as a result of this they both missed 1 week of school. My family and I were put up in the Imperial Hotel International for five days with no explanation as to what was happening. We were only told that a connecting flight would be available the next day. This went on for five days. I always made contact with the people who was in connection with those in charge as we was left in a situation not knowing when where going to get our flight. We then was put on a flight on the 5th day with the airline Air India to the Uk. We were given no financial or practical assistance or information from Biman Bangladesh as to what was happening and were left stranded with a young family for five days in a strange city. The situation would have been extremely stressful for anyone in my position however for my mother and me it was even more so as she suffers from high blood pressure and I am epileptic.,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Shupriya Iqbal,,1st March 2007,London -Dhaka-Sylhet recently. When we arrived at LHR it took over two ours to check in due to long queues. We were then told our flight was delayed but not told the reason for the delay or how long we would have to wait. Our flight ended up being delayed for 12 hours and it was a complete nightmare in the airport with two boys running around all over the place. After this ordeal we boarded the aircraft at midnight. I was appalled by the poor service dished out by Biman cabin crew. They were curt and less then helpful when I asked them for anything and avoided making eye contact. They made no effort whatsoever to make us comfortable. On the way back the journey was no better. Although we had prebooked to arrive by the last flight from Sylhet to Dhaka so the transit time before we boarded the plane for London would be shorter we were made to take the first flight to Dhaka when the tickets were reconfirmed. When we arrived in Dhaka it took over two hours of immigration checks and queues before we were taken to a hotel. Staff in Dhaka airport were completely oblivious to the needs of parents with young children. I had to stand in ceremony in front of countless officials who made us wait obscene lengths of time before they even noticed us. We were finally taken to a Hotel - it must have been one of the worst Hotels in Bangladesh. The four of us were ushered into a dark and dirty room with no windows or natural day light. The furniture was shoddy and falling apart carpet was stained blanket on the bed was filthy. On the flight back the service from the cabin crew was no better. By then I ceased to be appalled by anything because it is the norm with Biman Bangladesh airlines.,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Samina Nessa,,22nd January 2007,I recently flew with Biman accompanied by my 20-month old son from London to Dhaka to Sylhet. There was delays when boarding delays at Dhaka even though my flight was a direct one from London to Sylhet. During the night I was ignored by crew members despite my repeated requests for a blanket for my child. I eventually had to cover him with part of my sari to keep him warm. The toilets were filthy mother- &-baby changing facilities could not be found anywhere on the plane despite their notice being hung on a so-called baby-changing room. The crew were unhelpful and rude. At check-in in London I was told by a Biman representative to pay a 'reward' for the baggage handler to ignore my so-called overloaded baggage - which was NOT above the allowed weight! The food and service provided on board was shoddy to say the least. The plane was falling to bits seats and food trays did not stay where they were meant to a child seat belt had to be requested repeatedly by myself as crew members did not bother to check whether passengers had belted up. On the return journey I did not even bother asking for one - the hassle was too much. The most horrendous thing about Biman is that there is a serious lack of responsibility for passenger safety by crew members. This is quite frightening when travelling with young children. The return journey was very disorganised as we were required to reconfirm already confirmed tickets and once were contacted by their office to say the flight was delayed and to collect a new boarding pass which we had to pay for with our funds.,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,

Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Arafat Mahbub,,4th July 2006,Riyadh to Dhaka and back - my second time. After the many delays and poor service at the counter (one advantage being that if your vacation is very short you have it extended by the delays and you can blame it on the plane to dodge your superior's wrath!) I was in a queue for over 3 hours just to get through immigration! I finally boarded the plane which was parked way out on the tarmac and got there by the bus shuttle service. Was winter so I was spared the heat (this flight didn't have very good air-conditioning I think it was one of the older planes) but it can get quite stuffy. The cabin crew quite friendly and chatty. The seats had very little legroom even for my 5’6 frame. I had to push the neighboring passenger off my shoulder - thrice well we really can't blame him the seats didn't recline and were cramped. Food was ok considering I’ve tasted worse. Toilet seats were bad and lets not forget the train of ants on the toilet wall; I saw tiny roaches crawling on a another flight! I received my luggage 2 days after I reached Dhaka. I had some clothes and personal amenities in my carry-all so I survived - but most of the other people on my flight were not so lucky... If your traveling in winter and it's one of the newer planes at night I suggest you keep your outerwear as it can get quite chilly (provided there is air conditioning)  and blankets are in short supply. On one of my flights most people had turned in their jackets which were kept in a compartment behind the projector screen there weren't enough blankets to go around and so many people shivered mercifully children were given priority as for myself I had my jacket on - a cabin crew member suggested holding on to it - thanks to her. Well it's a very small fleet and so I guess not too much in the way of funds. As to whether I'll ever fly it again I don't know but in the mean time I'll put it on my list of airlines I'd fly only out of dire necessity.,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,L Fiddy,,17th May 2006,I guess I can only echo the complaints below and be thankful that I made it back to London in one piece. Journey to Bangkok uncomfortable and delayed for only 10 hours - (I understand now that this really is a walk in the park when flying with Biman). Return journey was not so smooth - after spending two days trying to reconfirm my already paid for tickets and finally giving up I was allowed to fly from Bangkok to Dakar. Bad mistake - why didn't they leave me in Bangkok where you can organise things normally - alas my path had been chosen - I was to land in Dakar and get told that I am not allowed to leave - great - its not like I have a job to go to and I could think of nothing better to do than spend the rest of my days rotting away in possibly the worst airport in the known world. 9 hours of hard negotiation a call to the British Embassy and some serious negotiation with the London office meant that I was able to board the flight 9 hours later with only 20mins to spare. If this had not happened I would have been trapped in Dakar for between 3-5 days. I am not a religious man but I must admit I was praying with everyone else at takeoff when I saw the decor and found a piece of the plane (not sure which) under the seat in front of me - I carefully replaced this and tried to forget that I ever saw it - an unscheduled stop in Dubai (clearly to drop off all the passengers that they had over booked onto all the already paid for tickets) meant the flight from Dakar to London took 17 hours - match this with a non-reclining seat - air stewards smoking on a non-smoking flight and distinct uncertainty if we were going to make it made for an experience I will never forget. Long live Biman since my return you have made me appreciate every minute of every day that I am still here.,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Terry Dryden,,10th February 2006,"New Delhi to Dhaka: without doubt the worst airline I've ever flown. On a scale of 0-10 with 0 the worst and 10 the best Biman rates -10. My check-in experience was horrendous. There was no order or organization and the process took over an hour - a good thing the flight was running a few hours late. I had to fight to keep people from cutting in line in front of me. The staff didn’t seem to know what they were doing and there didn’t seem to be enough staff. The excess baggage fee was highway robbery - I checked two bags and paid just over $125. And they don’t take credit cards. I was thankful that I had kept my Indian rupees so that I was able to pay the huge excess baggage fee. I can understand a shop in remote village not taking VISA but not an international airline. Their handling of cash would give an accountant a coronary. Make sure you keep good records of what you pay and who you give your cash to. I would have sworn that the antique looking Airbus 310 I flew Delhi to Dhaka was built back in the 19th century - never cleaned or maintained since. The unusual mechanical noises during taxi take off flight and landing were unnerving. The seats are small and tightly squished together - pity anyone taller than me (I'm 5'10"") I have no idea where they will put their legs. I was struggling to find someplace to put mine - heaven forbid if the passenger in front of you decides to recline back into your lap and face. I doubt I could have read a book on the flight. There wasn't room for one! Plus the pages would have burst into flames due to the extremely hot temperature inside the cabin (I had a thermometer with me) it was over 91 Fahrenheit (33 Celsius) and there was no air circulation which made it seem even hotter. If you don't have any natural padding don't expect to find any in the seats. And pray you don't have to use the restrooms during the flight. Many have over the years and most seem to have missed their target. After landing I really expected to look back (as if I could really see though the filthy dirty windows) and see wing parts debris one of the engines and all our luggage spread out behind the aircraft as we taxied roughly off the runway. After arriving in Dhaka only two and a half hours late I hoped my return flight would be better. But after reading the negative comments on this web forum I didn’t have much hope for a better flight back to Delhi. I just hoped I would survive! And a recent article in the local paper about Biman flights experiencing 50 hour delays in New York and multi day delays in Europe didn’t encourage me any. If anyone ever suggests that you fly on Biman walk instead. If you arrive at your destination you will be required to reconfirm your return flight at least 72 hours before your flight or your confirmed ticket will be canceled. That may be good or bad depending upon your perspective. Reconfirmation is another huge hassle with Biman. It took me six tries; once by phone as stated on their web site and twice at their office in Chittagong and I tried again without success at a travel agency. The lines at the Biman office were long and not moving maybe they had staff working the counters and maybe not it was hard to tell looking through the multitudes of people waiting in the dark room. I ran out of time during both attempts at the Biman Chittagong office and had to leave. When I got to the Chittagong airport I went to the Biman ticket counter and they couldn't reconfirm my ticket there. Finally a local friend spent several hours getting my return ticket reconfirmed for me in Dhakha. I don't see the logic of having to reconfirm already bought and paid for confirmed tickets. My return flight went better than my first one did. My experience at the check out counter went well. I thought it was interesting that my excess baggage fee was less than half what I paid on my first flight considering that I had a few more kilograms on this flight. The flight left on time and arrived on time in Delhi. I had some friends who flew from Mumbai to Dhaka the other day and their flight was fourteen hours late. The aircraft was an old DC-10 and this flight was not stuffed full. In fact I had an open seat next to me which gave my legs someplace to spread out to. The food was not as tasty as the first flight but so far I’ve not gotten sick. The cabin temperature was comfortable only during take off and landing. During flight the air temp was around 85 Fahrenheit (30 Celsius) without any air circulation still way too hot for my taste. I didn’t brave the restroom on this flight. I don’t plan to fly with Biman again. The hot cabin temp very tight seating space excessive excess baggage fees and the reconfirmation hassles are enough to keep me off their planes in the future. Seriously fly on another airline when you visit Bangladesh. The few dollars saved with Biman Bangladesh Airlines are not worth it.",,,,,,,,,,,no,,,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Iain Maciver,,19th December 2005,I never thought an airline could be this pathetic. Missed my Emirates connection from Dubai to Dhaka and put onto the Biman flight. Unreal! Lavatory doors broken - in the open position total seat fixed in place by many coats of paint last owner was spanish as all the signs etc were in that language (as though the Bangladesh passengers understood it)  excrement on the floor no air movement inside the cabin told to pull shades down to keep heat out. No food no drink no nothing for the entire flight. It was a sweat box by the time it landed. Surely ICAO should ground this outfit!!! Avoid this airline your life may depend on it!,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Thierry de Borchgrave,,10th December 2005,We tried to get to Bangkok with Biman Bangladesh starting from Paris Orly. We should have left from Paris on Sunday but the flight to Dhaka was cancelled. No announcement no information nothing. We managed to find a Biman representative who told us the flight would leave Monday morning. We could stay at a hotel close to the airport terminal paid by Biman. We (and some more people that slept on the airport floor because they did not find the well hidden Biman representative) left on Monday but not straight to Dhaka. First to Rome to pick up some other passengers that got stuck there. Finally we took off to Dhaka and landed there in the middle of the night. Tickets and passports were taken and we could stay in a dirty hotel until the morning because the flight to Bangkok was leaving on Monday morning. The bus to the airport never picked us up. No flights to Bangkok on Monday ! You will fly tomorrow morning we were told with a great smile. Finally we arrived in Bangkok Tuesday instead of Sunday. Return flight to Brussels via Dubai was okay only three hours delay - first time and last time ever with Biman Bangladesh.,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Jimmy Yu,,1st November 2005,Before takeoff the normal checks on passengers' safety belt was not carried out. There was a door latch that was unserviceable in the pantry. Before takeoff the cabin crew placed boxes in front of this door in the attempt to prevent it from flipping open. The exterior of the airplane was very dirty. The interior décor of the cabin is poor. The seat covers which have floral designs are old and tattered. A making tape was found pasted on one of the in-flight screen monitor. This monitor was suspected to have cracked at its edge. There was also a foul smell of lavatory in the cabin throughout the flight. Despite sound system being built in the seats earphones were never distributed to the passengers. No movie were screened during the flight. Other that the in- flight magazine ‘Digonto’ no other reading materials were available in the cabin. Orange juice was served before the flight. After airborne dinner which consists of only one meat puff and two springs rolls were served immediately. This meal was accompanied by hot beverage and plain water. The female cabin crew wears traditional ‘sari’ that gives the passenger an exotic South Asian feel. Only basic and essential service like food distribution was rendered to the passengers and nothing more. The cabin crew never smiled throughout. The standard of Biman cannot be comparable on the world stage -services are tolerable for very short haul flights but not suited for passengers intending to travel international beyond 5 hours of flight.,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Mehtab Rahman,,14th August 2005,DAC-CGP Business Class. Flight delayed by two hours. The smell of aircraft fuel lingered onboard throughout the flight. The business class with its infamous floral seat covers in tatters. The seat configuration 2-3-2 on an airbus A310. Seat pitch poor (tighter than any other J class I have flown - pitch similar to WT+ on BA). Inflight service is minimal; pax offered water sweets pan masala and Biman's trademark 'Mango Bar' (which is quite good). Overall an ok flight - nothing to write home about. Biman should consider revamping their aircrafts - they are horrible. I don't believe Biman will be purchasing a new fleet of B777s and A330/340's anytime soon so better not keep hopes high. A poor airline Biman should get its act together as quickly as possible.,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Jamal Ullah,,8th August 2005,London-Dhaka-Sylhet. We were a group of 17 and booked 4 months in advance. After check-in we were hurried to board the plane and was one of the last to board. Upon entering the plane I was disappointed with the interior flowery seat covers and it looked like something from the seventies. This was the Airbus A300 the National Express coaches in England look a lot smarter! There was a lot of confusion with seating and my family was split up they wanted my 4yr old daughter and my 3yr old son to sit some distance away from us the crew constantly saying let us take off then you can swap seats with anyone. In the end a compromise was found with another family. The flight was ok and surprisingly on time. Entertainment was nothing at all food not bad all I can say is they should improve the look of the planes interiors and modernise things or they are going to lose a lot of business to other carriers. The only reason a lot of people use Biman is because of convenience of landing in Sylhet airport (Biman does not allow any other international flight to land in Sylhet yet 90% of Biman passengers are Sylhetis),,,,,,,,,,,no,,,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Asif Ahmed,,5th September 2004,Delhi-Dhaka. Forced to take Biman as no other flights. Paid top fare as no discounts - in fact same fare as London-Delhi! Crew were awful. They ignored requests for blankets for the infant ordered passengers around and were very unhelpful with the pram. The screen did not work (on both ways) and so could not see any of the security demonstrations but it did not bother them. They made us sweat in the plane for absolutely ages before we had any aircon. The food was very poor quality and the drinks choice was lemonade cola or water - that's it! Filthy plane with ripped fittings. The crew did not check seat belts or close any trays and were no help at all with the infant belt. There seem to be many ranks of crew who ordered the lower ranks around! Many seats are taken up by free passengers who work for the airline or government. Use this airline at your peril!,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Matthew Taylor,,17th May 2004,"I can echo a lot of the comments already made about Biman. Our flight was delayed with no information being made available to passengers. We made stops en route that where not scheduled (at least not that WE were aware of). Due to delays we missed our connecting flight and spent Christmas day in a run down hostel with our tickets and passports taken away from us. On returning to the airport the following day we were told that our passports and tickets had been sent to the hostel - who decided not to tell us! We got them back with 5 minutes to spare! The staff are rude. Planes are falling apart (one member of our party complained that his seat would not stay upright and kept reclining - solution : ""Well don't lean back then!"". There was a strong smell of kerosene and the fascia on the emergency exit kept coming away from the door.",,,,,,,,,,,no,,,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,N Hussain,,28th March 2004,I recently flew Biman Bangladesh Airlines from Bombay to Dhaka on J Class. The flight in to Mumbai from Dubai was over 2 hours late. Biman did not bother informing the passengers and repeated phone calls to Biman's Mumbai airport office went unanswered. Check-in was a nightmare without any dedicated counter for J class passengers. Once on board the cabin was extremely dirty and the toilet in the front of the plane was simply filthy. The food was sub-par for J class. Most of the passengers in the J Class cabin seemed to be Biman staff. No apologies for the delay either. Very disappointed with the service which seems to be on a downward spiral as of late.,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Rebeka Boolaky,,15th March 2004,We recently flew by Biman Bangladesh with our 4 year old son and 6 month old baby - all I can say that it was an absolute nightmare from start to finish. We had requested a cot which we did not get. Met by rude unhelpful cabin crew and were in a filthy plane - on the return trip we were told that we were not on our flight because we had to re-confirm ? We are professional people with jobs to come back to not idle people who can stay for a few extra days/weeks! In Dhaka the staff were even more rude and to make things worse thay tried to make my 4 year old son sit on his own away from us - this I am sure is illegal and caused us a huge amount of stress !,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Basit Ahmed,,9th March 2004,I have flown Biman on the London-Dubai route many times. My belief is that service provided by Biman 20 or even 10 years ago was far superior to the service currently on offer. The reasons for this is that the DC-10s in use were younger at that time - cleaner and smoother. The main problems with Biman are that it has failed to modernise it's old fleet (root of all delays) failed to introduce modern in-flight entertainment (seatback videos) failed to address unprofessional hostesses failed to deal with it's corrupt booking officials and above all failed to appreciate the loyal customers which have kept it flying. I fly to Bangladesh regularly and since 1997 have been using Emirates which is truly a world class airline.,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,
Biman Bangladesh Airlines customer review,Sonya Mercado,,25th January 2004,Flew BG from Dhaka to Calcutta. The 737 (new to BG) was a filthy mess - all kinds of substances could be found on the seat pockets in J class. Legroom in J class which has a 3x3 seating was horrible. Food comprises of a box rudely thrown out at you. Dhaka airport is a nightmare and the airline hostesses just do not care.,,,,,,,,,,,no,,,

The food was okay but cold.,✅ Verified Review,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DAC to CCP,December 2016,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,no,2.0,,
"""quickly going downhill""",H Jenkins,Bangladesh,7th October 2016," Chittagong to Dhaka with Regent Airways. A moderately good airline that is quickly going downhill. I fly the Regent domestic route (Chittagong to Dhaka) 5 to 10 times a year for business and international routes (Dhaka - Bangkok and Dhaka - Kuala Lumpur) typically three times a year. Regent used to be my go-to option to avoid the national joke that is Biman Airlines, but over the past year, Regent's reliability with domestic flights has gone significantly downhill, with consistently late flights and a frequently chaotic check-in process to get a boarding pass. Regent now offers consistent delays of 30 - 90 minutes for a routine daily domestic flight and staff who open the ticketing counter 20 minutes before the flight's takeoff time and then rush passengers along as if it's their fault. Flight delays because of weather or other unavoidable circumstances are understandable, but when it's due to poor planning or airline staff just showing up late, it's absurd. I've emailed Regent directly using their online customer service form and, of course, haven't received any response.",✅ Verified Review,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,CGP to DAC,October 2016,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,no,3.0,,
"""nothing but praise""",Peter Ingram,Australia,15th September 2016," This is the second time I have flown with Regent Airways from Bangkok to Chittagong return. Nothing but praise from on line booking to great flight attendants. The food is ok - plenty of drinks (dry airline). On the return trip the purser was a fantastic guy, and all the other staff were friendly and helpful as well.

Flew to Chittagong on the 21st January, service was absolutely brilliant and cabin crew were marvellous. Food was delicious. Return was the same with a great crew (two of the crew remembered me from the previous trip), great comfort and food. All flights were on time. Comfortable seating in Business Class as well.

"""overall value for money""",N Morshed,Singapore,19th January 2016,"Dhaka to Singapore with Regent Airways. The check-in was smooth at Dhaka, better than my other check-in experiences at Dhaka.  The aircraft was a Boeing 737-700 which showed signs of aging. The interior needs refurbishment. The meal could have been better. The cabin crew was quite helpful and nice. There is no IFE in the cabin and difficult to kill time. Overall value for money.",,Boeing 737-700,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,DAC to SIN,January 2016,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,yes,3.0,,
Regent Airways customer review,S Walker,Bangladesh,29th January 2014,I have flown with Regent a couple of times between Dhaka and Chittagong and Cox's Bazar and in general have found them to be OK although the air conditioning on their Dash 8 aircraft frequently doesn't work. However more recently I have twice flown with Regent on their new 737-400 aircraft fro Dhaka to Bangkok. However when they say new this actually means new for them as both aircraft are leased from other airlines and are actually starting to show signs of age. Only one of them has an onboard entertainment system which didn't work when I was on board and the other (seemingly older) aircraft actually still has ash trays in the arm rests which have been taped up to stop people from using them but on a lot of the seats the ash trays have been removed leaving a rather sharp and dangerous metal edge on the end of the arm rest. On my last trip from BK back to Dhaka the Pilot went AWOL and so were almost 2 hours late leaving BK. The meals on board are very typically Bangladesh and not good and of course you cannot get an alcoholic drink on board. The tea and coffee is also pretty bad. The FA's are for the most part friendly enough but efficiency is not their highpoint. However despite their shortcomings their prices are very good.,,,,Economy Class,,,,,,4.0,yes,,,

Gyan Fernando",United Kingdom,1st November 2019, Jashore to Dhaka. A not well-known domestic airline in Bangladesh. The flight was late but we did get to our destination in a straight flight with no circling around. Being a short flight the cabin service was basic but adequate.
